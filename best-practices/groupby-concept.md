I had a hard time initially understanding `group by` command. The reason was mostly that I was trying to the what `group by` does via conditioning through `where` and aggregation functions.

I think the best way to understand `group by` is to use *coloring*. Just assume that the columns you are grouping, will have *rows of the same color, when the value of grouped column is the same for those rows.* This is being well demonstrated by an article[^1] from [learnsql.com](learnsql.com)
